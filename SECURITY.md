## üîê Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The Olympian AI team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: security@olympian-ai.dev
3. Include detailed information:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment
- **7 days**: Detailed response with action plan
- **30 days**: Fix implementation (for confirmed vulnerabilities)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use strong, unique secrets
   - Rotate credentials regularly

2. **API Keys**
   - Limit API key permissions
   - Use separate keys for development/production
   - Monitor API key usage

3. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Configure firewalls appropriately
   - Limit exposed ports

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Follow OWASP guidelines

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use dependency scanning tools
   - Review security advisories

3. **Authentication**
   - Implement proper JWT validation
   - Use secure password hashing
   - Enable MFA where possible

## üîç Security Features

### Current Implementation

- JWT-based authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting with auto-adjustment
- CORS policy enforcement
- Webhook signature verification
- Secure WebSocket connections

### Planned Enhancements

- [ ] OAuth2/OIDC support
- [ ] End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Security headers middleware
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Local Development**
   - Default configurations are not secure
   - Services may be exposed without authentication

2. **Service Discovery**
   - Network scanning may trigger security alerts
   - Ensure proper network isolation

## üìù Security Checklist

### Before Deployment

- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Generate new JWT secrets
- [ ] Configure HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Set up firewall rules
- [ ] Enable rate limiting
- [ ] Configure CORS appropriately
- [ ] Review and update dependencies
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create security audit logs
- [ ] Test for common vulnerabilities

### Regular Maintenance

- [ ] Weekly: Review logs for anomalies
- [ ] Monthly: Update dependencies
- [ ] Quarterly: Security audit
- [ ] Annually: Penetration testing
